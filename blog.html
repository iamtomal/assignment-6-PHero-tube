    <br><br><br>

    <p class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-100">
    1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const .
    </p><br>

    <p class="text-lg">
        <span class="font-bold text-xl text-blue-200">Answer: <br></span> When we declare a "var" variable outside an external function, that variable is in global scope. When a "var" variable is declared inside a function, that variable is only accessible inside that function.
        <br>When 'let' is declared outside a function, it is declared in global scope. 'let' is only accessible within the function's scope when declared within a function.
        <br>When 'const' is declared outside a function, it is declared in global scope. Such variables are accessible throughout the program and the value of a variable declared with 'const' cannot be changed once the value has been set.
    </p><br><br>




    <p  class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-100">
    2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined .
    </p><br>

    <p class="text-lg">
        <span class="font-bold text-xl text-blue-200">Answer: <br></span>Null-  'Null' is sometimes used to denote the value of data and variables. For example, if a variable has no value set, it is set to 'Null'. If any data is missing in the database, 'Null' is used to represent it.
        <br> Undefined-  When a variable has no value set or a variable is not declared, the variable takes the value 'undefined'. When a property or method is not present on an object, the property or method may be 'undefined'.

    3. What do you mean by REST API?
    </p><br>

    <p class="text-lg">
        <span class="font-bold text-xl text-blue-200">Answer: <br></span>
        "Representational State Transfer" (REST), which can be easily expressed piecewise and locally, and is easily scalable. The REST API makes data provisioning and data requests simple and efficient and can be used across multiple platforms.
